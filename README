DESCRIPTION
    CatalystX-Crudite is a framework for writing Catalyst-based CMS web
    applications. It includes out-of-the-box user and role management and
    many starter templates. It builds upon CatalystX-Resource and
    CatalystX-SimpleLogin.

    In order for "crudite_starter" to work, you need to install this
    distribution. The starter templates are stored as per-dist shared files
    using "File::ShareDir", so they can't be found from the uninstalled
    repository. I hope to improve this in a later version.

CONFIGURATION
    The user can specify extra args for web libraries such as specific
    versions. Example:

        __PACKAGE__->config_app(
            name                     => 'MyApp',
            'CatalystX::Crudite'     => {
                web_library => {
                    Bootstrap => { version => '2.3.2' },
                },
            },
            # other standard Catalyst config such as:
            'Plugin::Static::Simple' => {
                include_path => [ __PACKAGE__->path_to(qw(root static)), \&dir2 ],
                ignore_extensions => [qw(tmpl tt tt2 xhtml)]
            }
        );

    By default the latest versions of the web libraries - Bootstrap, jQuery,
    jQueryUI and DataTables - are laoded.
